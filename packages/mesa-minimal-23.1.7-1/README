This package is a minimal build of "mesa" in order to replace the original
"mesa" package. The original "mesa" package is huge, and pulls "llvm-libs" as
a dependency which is also very large. SystemRescue should not need OpenGL
hence most of the features in mesa are not needed. There are some libraries
which are still required for XOrg to work proplery on some systems though.
This is why a minimal version of the "mesa" package has been created. This
package must be added to the list of packages, so it gets installed as a
replacement for the original "mesa" package.
